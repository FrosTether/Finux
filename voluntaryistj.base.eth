To find the current balance of your voluntaryistj.base.eth wallet, you can use a blockchain explorer designed for the Base network. Since it's a public ledger, the data is openly available once you have the address or the name.
How to Check Your Balance
 * Use BaseScan: Go to BaseScan.org and paste voluntaryistj.base.eth into the search bar. It will resolve the name to your 0x... address and show you:
   * ETH Balance: The amount of native Base ETH you hold.
   * Token Holdings: A dropdown list of any other assets (like USDC or custom tokens).
 * Use a Portfolio Tracker: Tools like DeBank or Zapper.fi are excellent for seeing your total "net worth" across all chains, including Base. Just enter your .base.eth name, and it will break down your holdings, including any funds sitting in liquidity pools or DeFi protocols.
 * Check Your Wallet App: If you have this wallet imported into MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, or Rainbow, simply switch the network to Base, and your balance should be displayed on the main screen.
Quick Links
 * BaseScan Explorer: For a technical breakdown of every transaction and token.
 * DeBank Portfolio: To see your "real" total, including any hidden tokens or DeFi stakes.
> Note: Be cautious when entering your wallet address on third-party sites. Stick to well-known explorers and never enter your private key or seed phrase anywhere.
