1. Title of Invention
System and Method for Cross-Chain Identity Migration and Cryptographic Recovery using Genesis-State Tethering
2. Abstract of the Disclosure
A method for the non-custodial migration of digital assets and identity between disparate decentralized ledgers. The system utilizes a "Genesis-State Snapshot" to capture legacy account data, including reputation and balance, and injects it into a secondary blockchain's initial state. Identity verification is facilitated through a multi-factor authentication protocol involving a pre-forked "Tattoo Script" (a persistent, hardcoded biometric-linked string) and a PGP-signed handshake. This "hot-swap" mechanism ensures the continuity of the user's social and financial graph without requiring the original private keys of the source ledger, provided the identity tether is cryptographically verified against a stagnant legacy address.
3. Technical Field
The present invention relates generally to the field of blockchain interoperability and cryptographic security. More specifically, it pertains to systems that facilitate asset recovery and identity persistence across forked or sister chains using state-injection and persistent biometric-linked authentication scripts.
4. Background of the Invention
Current blockchain ecosystems suffer from "Asset Stagnation," where lost private keys or defunct recovery emails result in the permanent loss of digital capital. Existing recovery methods often rely on centralized custodians, which contradicts the decentralized nature of distributed ledgers. There is a technical need for a decentralized protocol that can "bridge" the value of a lost or stagnant account to a new system while maintaining rigorous proof of ownership.
5. Detailed Description of the Invention
A. The Genesis-State Injection (Migration Block #1)
The invention introduces a method for creating a "Migration Block." Unlike standard transaction blocks, this block is a state-level injection that recognizes legacy holdings from a "Source Ledger" (e.g., 1cnjacobfrost.blockchain). The migration is triggered when the protocol verifies that the source funds have been immobile for a predefined "Stagnation Period" (e.g., 5 years) and a valid "Tether Claim" is submitted.
B. The "Tattoo Script" Authentication Anchor
To solve the problem of lost email/phone recovery, the invention utilizes a persistent authentication string, termed the "Tattoo Script." This script acts as a hardcoded, low-level bypass that is uniquely tied to the user’s physical or cryptographic identity. In a "Hot Swap" scenario, the script allows the user to re-anchor their identity to a new public address (e.g., the Kraken-anchored vault) by proving knowledge of the Genesis String, which is never stored on a public ledger in its raw form.
C. The Frostner Lock (DPoS Social Layer)
The system incorporates a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) social layer (e.g., amiah.do) where "Witness Nodes" act as validators for the migration. These nodes verify the PGP-signed handshake from the user's recovery contact (e.g., voluntaryistj@riseup.net) before finalizing the state transition in the new ledger.
Next Steps for your IP Strategy
 * File the PPA: You can do this online at USPTO.gov.
 * Mark Your Code: Once filed, you can add "Patent Pending" to your GitHub README and your amiah.do wiki.
 * Trade Secret: Keep the specific "Tattoo Script" string and the PGP private keys as trade secrets. The method is what you are patenting, not the keys themselves.
