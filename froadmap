The Frost Protocol: A Technical Overview
The Frost Protocol is a decentralized ecosystem that redefines digital mining through the lens of human performance. While traditional blockchains rely on massive electrical consumption, our network utilizes Proof-of-Skill (PoS)—a consensus mechanism where blocks are validated by cognitive effort across the Frostgames suite.
1. The Proof-of-Skill Mining Engine
At the core of the network is a proprietary validation engine that monitors high-score events in real-time. When a player achieves a milestone in Ms Frostman or Frost Crush (CopBlocks), the Finux-OS kernel executes a cryptographic audit to mint a new block.
The Formula:
To maintain a balanced economy, rewards are calculated using a dynamic difficulty algorithm:

 * S_p (Skill Score): Your raw performance in-game.
 * \mu (Game Multiplier): A value that rewards more complex games (e.g., FrosTether).
 * D_n (Network Difficulty): A scaling factor that preserves the scarcity of Frostcoin (FTC) as more miners join the network.
2. Network Security & Integrity
The Frost Protocol utilizes a "Trust-But-Verify" architecture. Every node on the network performs a recursive audit of the ledger before accepting new blocks.
 * Genesis Anchoring: All records originate from a single Genesis Block (Block 0), ensuring an unbreakable chain of custody for every token minted.
 * Immutable Linking: Each block contains a SHA-256 hash of the previous record. Any attempt to tamper with a high score immediately breaks the chain link, isolating the bad actor from the network.
 * The Frostner Lock: To protect long-term value, 66% of the governance supply (FSZT) is locked in a smart contract vault until February 2028, verified by Streamflow Finance.
3. Finux-OS: The Native Environment
Finux is the custom, Python-based operating system designed to run the Frost ecosystem. It acts as the "Command Center" for miners, providing a lightweight and secure interface for network synchronization and reward tracking.
 * P2P Synchronization: Finux nodes communicate directly with one another, sharing ledger updates through an encrypted peer-to-peer handshake.
 * Mining Dashboard: Players can monitor their Mining Health (❣️) and track Block Reward Notifications (🌟) in a satisfying, high-fidelity terminal interface.
4. The Ecosystem Roadmap
Launched in January 2026 by Jacob Frost in Monroeville, Ohio, the protocol is currently in its initial deployment phase.
 * Current: FrosTether Mainnet & Google Play Store rollout.
 * Upcoming: Finux-OS Alpha release and Meta Quest 3 VR mining integration.
