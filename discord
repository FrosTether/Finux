To scale the Frost Miners community across Discord, Telegram, and WhatsApp, you need a unified communication strategy. In 2026, the most successful launches focus on community-first growth over short-term hype, prioritizing education and direct support.

Use this template for your first broadcast. It is optimized to work across all three platforms while highlighting the unique "Proof-of-Skill" aspect of FrosTether.

2. Platform-Specific Integration Tips
To manage all three platforms without being overwhelmed, follow these 2026 best practices:
 * Discord (The Operational Heart): Use your #announcements channel as the "Source of Truth". Set up a bot to automatically cross-post these messages to your Telegram channel to save time.
 * Telegram (The Support Desk): Treat your Telegram as a high-speed support hub. Pin your #📜-mining-rules and a link to the FrosTether-Core GitHub so developers can find the technical docs immediately.
 * WhatsApp (The Direct Line): Use WhatsApp Business features like "Quick Replies" for frequently asked questions about Finux-OS installation or FTC rewards.
3. Cross-Platform "Quest" Strategy
Drive growth by creating tasks that require users to engage across the entire ecosystem:
 * The Proof: Post a screenshot of a "MINTED" block in the Discord #block-rewards channel.
 * The Connection: Invite one friend to the Telegram group using your direct link.
 * The Reward: Users who complete both get the "Genesis Miner" role, giving them early access to Finux-OS Alpha builds.
Launch Day Security Check
 * Moderation: Ensure your Discord has basic AI-powered moderation to filter out scam links immediately.
 * Verification: Use a "Reaction Role" or a simple bot in Discord so users must agree to the rules before seeing the private mining channels.
