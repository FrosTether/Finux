## 🧊 Overview

**Finux** (formerly FrostOS) is a custom mobile operating system layer built on a Python/Kivy core, optimized for Android hardware. Unlike traditional mobile skins, Finux utilizes a proprietary **Proof of Thermal Work (PoTW)** protocol.

By capturing and redirecting the thermal energy generated by device processing, Finux validates cryptographic transactions on the **FrostChain**, effectively allowing the device to offset its own power consumption through "Thermal Mining."

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Virgo Adaptive Kernel (v4.0)
The heart of Finux is the **Virgo v4.0** kernel. It dynamically manages CPU states based on thermal output rather than just load.
* **Blizzard Mode:** Maximum cooling efficiency for standard usage.
* **Overheat Mode:** Unlocked thermal ceiling for high-performance tasks and cryptographic validation.

### 2. Proof of Thermal Work (PoTW)
A novel consensus mechanism that utilizes waste heat as a variable for cryptographic difficulty.
* **FrostMaster.py:** The core logic file that bridges hardware thermal sensors with the blockchain layer.
* **Native Wallet:** Integrated directly into the OS shell for holding Frostcoin and FrosTether.

### 3. Frost Protocol Ecosystem
Finux is the flagship interface for the broader Frost Protocol, integrating seamless connectivity with:
* **FrostChain:** The underlying ledger.
* **FrostGames:** Native gaming support with crypto-rewards.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Core Logic:** Python 3.10+
* **UI/UX Engine:** Kivy (Open Source Python library for rapid development of applications that make use of innovative user interfaces)
* **Mobile Bridge:** Buildozer / Ionic Appflow
* **Backend Services:** Firebase, Tatum API
* **Hardware Target:** Android-based mobile devices (Arm64 architecture)
